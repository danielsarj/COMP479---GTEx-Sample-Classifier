# COMP479 - GTEx Sample Classifier

## Introduction

It is known that gene expression patterns vary between tissues in the human body. Consequently, it may be possible to classify RNA-Seq samples based on their expression profiles. Thus, to test this hypothesis, we decided to build a logistic regression classifier trained on GTEx RNA-Seq data. This is a final project developed for the COMP479 Machine Learning course at Loyola University Chicago. 

## Requirements

In this GitHub repo, you can find the main script (`main_script.py`) and some test data. For the full data, you may download it directly from GTEx Portal in [here](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets) - files `GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct.gz` and `GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt`. Besides those files, the general requirements to run the main script are:

* Python (3.9.7 or later)
* Pandas (1.3.4 or later)
* Numpy (1.20.3 or later)
* Scikit-learn (0.24.2 or later)

## Implementation

To be added.
